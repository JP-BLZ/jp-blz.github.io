I help organizations across the world to move or build their infrastructure in the cloud. I work with organizations from various domains and industries. I have worked as a full-stack developer for most of my professional life. And I enjoy learning new technologies.

This is a technical blog to share my experience and learnings while working on AWS and associated technologies.
